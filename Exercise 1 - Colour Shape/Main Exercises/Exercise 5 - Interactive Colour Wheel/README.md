#Interactive Colour Wheel

For this exercise, I wanted add the ability to press and hold down a key and the colour wheel segment would become a random range between the HSB values. Another was to press down a key and for the colourMode to change back to RGB until the key was released. Another addition I wanted to add but couldn't get working is the addition of another for loop  for mouseY interaction- this would increase the brightness when the mouse is moved in the Y axis.

Key R & Key T create another colour wheel within the larger one.
