#First Steps

1. Created canvas with p5
2. Changed colour type of sketch to HSB (hue saturation boldness)
3. First created rectangle (rect) to demonstrate the canvas working and filled it.
4. Changed around stroke widths, colours, and removed strokes from rectangle.


##Second Steps

1. First began with assigning variables as stepX, denoting the steps between each of the rectangles to come.
2. Created first for loop, which would contain a second for loop within. The first for loop contained the code for creating the rectangles down the Y axis of the canvas. This was assigned as gridY.
3. Second for loop repeated with X axis. Rectangles created were then filled.

##Additional steps

1. Finally, we added the ability to save an image on the canvas through the keyPressed() function. When the S key is pressed, accounting for lowercase and uppercase, the image on the canvas is saved as a png file with timestamp.

2. We also used mouseX and mouseY in place of predetermined steps.
