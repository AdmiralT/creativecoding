# CA1 - Generative Art Design

This assignment concluded our learning of distance, atan, interpolation, mapping and integrated knowledge that we learned ourselves. For this assignment, I chose to learn about bezier curves and how they can be applied to a generative art piece.

Bezier curves feature 8 required values, but can have up to 12 with further coordinates. The values required for a bezier curve are:

1. x1: X coordinate for the first anchor point.
2. y1: Y coordinate for the first anchor point.
3. x2: X coordinate for the first control point.
4. y2: Y coordinate for the first control point.
5. x3: X coordinate for the second control point.
6. y3: Y coordinate for the second control point.
7. x4: X coordinate for the second anchor point.
8. y4: Y coordinate for the second anchor point.

Utilising bezier curves in a generative design proved to be quite a tricky thing to do- iterating through a for loop using the values within a bezier can often lead to unpredictable behaviour and designs. While interesting, these did not fit what I wanted to achieve with my design.

The design went through a number of iterations while I was working through how best to approach using bezier curves, and I eventually settled on using 4 sets of bezier curves that utilized the for loop iterations to create a number of different curves from a single method.

While I did not achieve exactly what I wanted with using bezier curves, I feel that I did learn a great deal about generative design through the project.
