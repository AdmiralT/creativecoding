# Pi and Atan

This exercise served as the initial introduction to our later usage of tan, atan and pi functions within p5. The purpose of this exercise was to create a number of lines that would then rotate based on the atan between the point's origin and the mouse coordinates. The amount it would rotate by would be dependent on the the number of segments created, divided by two_pi.

`  numSegments = 10;
  stepAngle = TWO_PI/numSegments;`
